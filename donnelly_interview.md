EXTRA NOTES

Connecticut is unique in that there are two peaks 

it's one of the key seasonal features of connecticut

they pay attention to the trees

the main thing we've been doing
set up and developed based on reporting 
and many years now

what they've observed based on this time of year

yeah, 
it means a lot ot the economy of connectciut
beautiful backdrop and unqiue new england leaf color change

one o fthe things about connect's forrest, 
our leaf chang emight be different 

it's very mixed forest

there's more diversity in terms of number of treas in ct than in most parts of the country

it's just differnet types of growing regions
couple fo them overlap in connecticut
so if you go further north it's typically known as the northern hardwoods
so the fall color in new hampshire is from the norther hardwoods

sugar maple is a large part of the mix

lesser amounts of oaks

as you come down into CT
the northern hardwoods meet the central hardwoods
so we have a large compnent of both in the state

variety of mapels
not just sugar maples

knowon for the 
mix of ash trees, the oaks, birches, so it's a real mix moreso than north or south or here

every year is different
and 

it's hard to have any quantification for that

all those factors go into it in every year
perfect example of that is 2011, when we had irene
irene came at the end of august
and we had wet weather after that

took a lot of leaves off the trees
caused a fair amount of fungus

it wasn't a bright year

it's because
a lot of that you can blame on irene
and all the wet weather that followed it

so you know, every year will be different
a dry year may stretch the color change out
because as trees get stressed they turn in later parts

some of the trees will chang eearly basically the tree's ar epacking it in for the season when they've been dry

they're initiating earlier

temperature is a big factor in fall foliage

that's kind of without a doubt
particuarly if we get cool nights and weather that approaches but does not hit freezing

can lead to a spectacular year

it's hard to predict how you'll get that
if it goes below freezing then it doesnt manufacture the chemicals that lead to vibrant colors

if you dont have that specific 

the yellows and oranges are not really affected as much by temp?
thats what makes it so interesting
all these factors play their part
and diferent combinations of factors in a given year

i cant predict

i think it's going to be a good year
looking at westrock in new haven

a lot of the trees that are along the streets
and you can look at the hillside
the trees affected by dry weather
but at the same time there's a lot of forest that still ahs fairly deep green leaves
they look like the trees are, still ahve a lot of leave
and so they're going to turn 

on eo f the  int things about connecticut
because we have dual peaks

oaks-- they tuedn to turn later than the maples and ashes and so on

so we get our first peak within the first two weeks of octoborer
and then in the third and fourth we tend to have a second peak with the oaks and get that real brown purply colors of late fall

i think those leaf changes are going to be as good as ever in connecticut
