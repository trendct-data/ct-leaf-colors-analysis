From CT DEEP: Color gradient map is based upon historic field observations by Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Foresters. Local conditions may be influenced by summer rainfall and autumn day and night temperature fluctuations. Individual trees may vary, too. A healthy, vibrant tree will retain its leaves longer and produce more flamboyant colors at its peak just prior to leaf fall.
