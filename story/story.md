When the leaves will change in Connecticut

The peak time to witness the leaves changing colors in Connecticut depends laregly on what part of the state you live in but generally happens during October, though in the future, that could happen earlier due to climate change, according to researchers. 

But this year, forestry officials say the best time in the northern part of the state is the first half of October while the southern half of the state can wait until the second half of October.

Their foliage <a href="http://www.depdata.ct.gov/forestry/foliage/foliagemap.htm">estimation map</a> is based on the observations from forestry workers at the Connecticut Department of Energy & Environmental Protection. 

Trend CT determined the daily dominant color of leaves between 2012 and 2015 by scraping and analyzing thousands of images from the state's <a href="http://www.ct.gov/deep/cwp/view.asp?a=2684&q=404638&depNav_GID=1744">outdoor haze and visibility cameras</a> on Cornwall Mohawk Mountain and Talcott Mountain Science Scenter that overlooks Hartford.

On Mohawk Moutain, the pine tree leaves begin to turn orange as early as mid September. Green doesn't stop being the dominant hue until mid October.

Connecticut stands out among the other states in New England because it's where the northern hardwoods meets the central hardwoods, said Chris Donnelly, Urban Forestry Coordinator for the state's Division of Forestry. 

This effectively gives Connecticut two peaks for leaves changing color— once in the first two weeks of Octobober and the second in the second two weeks of the month.

"There's more diversity in terms of number of trees in Connecticut than in most parts of the country," said Donnelly. There are nearly 20 different types of trees across Connecticut with different <a href="http://www.ct.gov/deep/cwp/view.asp?a=2697&q=322760&deepNav_GID=1631">fall color tendencies</a>.

By Talcott Mountain, the leaves begin to turn orange and yellow in early September and becomes the dominant colors in mid October.

The chemical chlorophyll in the leaves is what gives them the green color. In the fall, when temperatures cool, trees begin to block the flow of water to their leaves, so the chlorophyll breaks down, revealing vibrant colors of yellow, orange, or red.

A variety of factors contribute to the colors of leaves changing— from temperature to moisture and light exposure. Generally, the more light trees get and the lower the temperature, but not freezing, the more brilliant the foliage colors, said officials. A dry year can lead to the fall leaf colors lingering longer than usual.

Autumn phenology, what researchers call the colors changing and leaves dropping, can be affected by variable factors such as drought, heat, and rainfall between spring and fall.

WEATHER CHANGE

Donnelly recalled that 2011 was a particularly dull year due to Hurricane Irene and the following rain storms throughout the season. The leaves were prematurely dropped and a fair amount of fungus prevented the colors to reach their full potential, he said.

Weather has a vast impact on the colorfulness of the leaves in the fall, particularly changing weather patterns and climate change, according to researchers from the University of Connecticut.

In the coming decades, Connecticut and New England's color changes will be less vibrant and happen earlier in the year.

This is based future climate projections, which will lead to increased evening temperatures and heavier rainfall. 

The more trees are stressed, the earlier they shut down for the year.
